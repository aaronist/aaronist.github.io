<p>These intentionally misleading messages, commonly referred to as &ldquo;spam&rdquo;, are much more prolific in today&rsquo;s world given the universality and convenience of SMS. Luckily for us, machine learning is also rapidly growing, and it can serve as a great mechanism for automatically filtering spam messages. In fact, there has already been extensive research done on this topic, and I would highly recommend taking a look at the machine learning models that others have deployed in order to tackle this problem.</p>
